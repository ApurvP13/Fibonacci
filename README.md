# Fibonacci
Fibonacci Series In Java Implementation with threading and cache.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the next few values in the sequence are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

To Implement this software, I used the langaue Java and with the use of Threads and Cache, this fibonacci generator is faster than the one we can generate using recursion.
